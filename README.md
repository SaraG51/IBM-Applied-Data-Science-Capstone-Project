Final Project: Tools for Data Science 

This capstone project predicts if SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage will land successfylly.  
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of 62 million dollars.  Other launch
providers offer launches at more than 165 million dollars.  SpaceX costs are lower due to the 
reusability of their the Falcon 9 first stage.  If it can be determined if the first stage will
successfully land, we can determine the cost of a launch.  SpaceX competitors can use this 
information to bid against SpaceX.
